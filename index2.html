 <p>Nikola Tesla's life is a remarkable saga of innovation, brilliance, and a vision of a future transformed by electricity. Born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, a village in modern-day Croatia, Tesla was a prodigious inventor whose work fundamentally shaped the modern world. His journey from a curious child in a small European town to an influential figure in the realm of electrical engineering is a story of genius and perseverance.</p></details>

 Tesla's early education was marked by an exceptional aptitude for mathematics and science. After attending the Technical University at Graz and later the University of Prague, he began working in various engineering positions. His first major breakthrough came with his development of the alternating current (AC) electrical system, which was a significant improvement over the direct current (DC) system promoted by Thomas Edison. Tesla's AC system proved to be more efficient for transmitting electricity over long distances, and his work paved the way for the widespread adoption of AC power.</p></details>

 In 1888, Tesla's AC system gained substantial recognition when he collaborated with George Westinghouse, who helped to commercialize his inventions. This partnership culminated in the famous "War of the Currents," a battle between AC and DC systems. Tesla's AC technology ultimately triumphed, leading to its adoption in the construction of the world's first major hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls. This achievement marked a turning point in electrical engineering and solidified Tesla's reputation as a pioneering inventor.</p></details>

 Despite his groundbreaking work, Tesla's life was marked by financial difficulties and eccentricities. He was known for his intense focus on his research, which often led to periods of financial instability. Tesla's unconventional behavior and grandiose visions, including ideas for wireless power transmission and advanced communication technologies, were sometimes met with skepticism. Nonetheless, his contributions to science and engineering were immense.</p></details>

 Nikola Tesla passed away on January 7, 1943, in New York City, leaving behind a legacy that would only be fully appreciated posthumously. Today, Tesla is celebrated as a visionary who revolutionized the way we harness and use electricity. His name lives on not only through his inventions but also in the Tesla unit of magnetic flux density and the electric car company named in his</p></details>
